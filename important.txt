I will share you codes related to today's class in evening,
however, in the meantime, I want to clarify that what I have written:

x = x * 10 + (s[i] -'0')  gives error in python

However following codes work:

x = x * 10 + int(s[i])
or

x = x * 10 + (ord(s[i])- ord(s[i]))


However following comparison works fine:
  if s1[i] > s2[i]
