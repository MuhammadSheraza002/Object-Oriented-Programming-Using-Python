Flood is a type of natural hazard, affecting humans and natural habitats, or even killing them. A flood can also cause severe damage to homes, factories, places in public, etc. Initially, the trees in the forest should not be cut down unethically because they can cause many human disasters, which include flooding. A flood occurs; therefore, it is not possible to absorb the rainwater in the plant root, so water flows directly. Secondly, in our properties, in the desert field and along the side of the road, we can plant any plants so that the plant root can quickly suck up the water. It provides other incentives, such as reducing air contamination and embracing the ‘Go Green’ Global Warming and Climate Change Policy on our Planet. The last thing is that we should not throw waste anywhere to disturb the flow of the river. In Jakarta, for example, people want to dump the trash somewhere as in the canal, and also in the drainage, resulting in flooding every year. In many other places, such as Situ Gintung and Wasior, the other flood is because people like to throw waste anywhere. By doing that, we can minimize disasters and contribute to defending our environment. So, we have to keep our environment clean.
